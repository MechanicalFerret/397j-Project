# 397j-Project

This was the final project for a 1-credit course I took in my Senior Year at UMass Amherst. The course revolved around learning the Impact Javascript game engine and creating our own game at the end of the course.

What is found here is the source for a small top-down space shooter that has the player moving with the WASD keys and firing missiles with the SPACEBAR. It features two types of enemies, ones that shoot vertically and others that fly in horizontally along with astroids and powerups for the players to collect.
